## Summary 
This document describes the development of a prototype called `ClassHub`, aimed at improving communication between students and their tutors at the Autonomous University of Yucatán. The project arose from the need to address the lack of interest and communication between students and tutors, especially in the first semesters. Through research and analysis, problems such as lack of information on course requirements, disconnection between students and tutors, and lack of curiosity in establishing communication were identified.

## Introduction 
This document explains the reasons why the assigned tasks were carried out and how the prototype was developed. This work lasted one week, aiming to showcase the prototype.

## Situation Analysis 
To develop the prototype, conferences were held where the team suggested ideas to establish the prototype's purpose, resulting in `ClassHub`. The product description presents ClassHub's value proposition and benefits.

> ### Student-Tutor Communication
>   
> At the Autonomous University of Yucatán, faculties assign tutors to students for guidance and support. Communication occurs through email exchanges and mutual agreements on schedules and objectives. Two types of tutoring exist: individual and group sessions.

> ### Background
>
>  Professor Edgar Martínez shared an anecdote about students mistakenly selecting courses due to lack of information, leading to course failure.

> ### Problem Statement
>
> Despite the desired six tutoring sessions per academic year, most first-semester students lack interest in communicating with tutors, causing academic difficulties.

> ### Delimitation
>
> The study focused on first-semester students with emerging questions and doubts.

> ### Justification
>
> New university students often face adaptation challenges.

> ### Objectives
> 
> To encourage students to communicate with tutors.

> ### Purpose and Proposals
>  
> Create a website to improve student-tutor communication and provide attractive tools.

> ### Research Questions
>
> - Why don't students communicate with tutors?
> - How many students communicate or don't?
> - Do students know their tutors' roles?
> - How do tutors handle the situation?

## Conclusion 
The `ClassHub` prototype aims to solve communication problems between students and tutors, especially in the first semesters. Objectives include:

- [ ]  Increase student-tutor communication
- [ ]  Provide attractive user tools
- [ ]  Facilitate access to tutor information
