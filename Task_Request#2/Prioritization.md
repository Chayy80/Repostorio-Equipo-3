# Prioritization Levels
______________________

## Requirements prioritization is based on the following criteria:

### Fundamental Requirements (1.0):

- **Criterion:** Essential for the system to function.
- **Argument:** Without these requirements, the system will not fulfill its basic function or operate correctly.
- **Examples:** Login, message notifications, accessibility.

### Recommended Requirements (2.0):

- **Criterion:** Improve the user experience.
- **Argument:** Add extra value to the system by optimizing its functionality and usability.
- **Examples:** Subject-based chat rooms, history of shared files.

### Optional Requirements (3.0):

- **Criterion:** Extras that do not affect essential functionality.
- **Argument:** These features can be excluded without compromising the system’s basic operation.
- **Examples:** Curriculum view, advanced visual design.

The prioritization was decided by focusing on each requirement’s necessity for functionality, user experience, and the possibility of omitting some features without affecting the basic system.
