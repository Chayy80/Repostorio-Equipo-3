**Introduction:**
Our project addresses a key problem that many university students face: the lack of effective communication with their academic tutors during the course registration process. This prototype aims to create a software solution that closes this gap by facilitating clear, timely and organized interaction between students and their tutors. This way, students can make more informed decisions about their course selection, ensuring they stay on track with their academic goals and receive appropriate guidance from their tutors.

**Problem Statement:**  
Currently, many students struggle to receive the necessary guidance from their tutors when selecting courses at university. This lack of communication can lead to students choosing courses that do not align with their academic profile, delaying their progress or affecting their performance. Our prototype aims to address this issue by providing a platform that facilitates direct and smooth interaction between students and tutors, promoting informed and collaborative decision-making.

**Objective:**  
To create a software prototype that resolves the communication gap between students and tutors during course selection, ensuring that students receive appropriate advice from their tutors in a timely manner.

**Vision:**  
To enable efficient communication between students and tutors during the course registration process, creating an environment where both parties can coordinate effectively to optimize course selection.

**Mission:**  
To develop a technological solution that allows students and tutors to interact clearly and in an organized manner during the course registration process, improving transparency and guidance in academic decision-making.
