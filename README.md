# **Project Title: ClassHUB**

## **Introduction**
Our project addresses a key problem that many university students face: the lack of effective communication with their academic tutors during the course registration process. This prototype aims to create a software solution that closes this gap by facilitating clear, timely, and organized interaction between students and their tutors. In this way, students can make more informed decisions about their course selection, ensuring they stay on track with their academic goals and receive appropriate guidance from their tutors.

## **Problem Statement**
Currently, many students struggle to receive the necessary guidance from their tutors when selecting courses at university. This lack of communication can lead to students choosing courses that do not align with their academic profile, delaying their progress or affecting their performance. Our prototype aims to address this issue by providing a platform that facilitates direct and smooth interaction between students and tutors, promoting informed and collaborative decision-making.

## **Objective**
To create a software prototype that resolves the communication gap between students and tutors during course selection, ensuring that students receive appropriate advice from their tutors in a timely manner.

## **Vision**
To enable efficient communication between students and tutors during the course registration process, creating an environment where both parties can coordinate effectively to optimize course selection.

## **Mission**
To develop a technological solution that allows students and tutors to interact clearly and in an organized manner during the course registration process, improving transparency and guidance in academic decision-making.

## **Branch Configuration by Team Member**

Each team member will have a dedicated branch, identified by a unique numerical code to streamline task management and track changes. Below is the format for assigning and organizing each team member's branch.

### **Branch Naming Format**
Each branch follows the format:  
`FIS#_[Numerical_Code]_[Task]`

- **FIS#**: Project or module identifier.
- **Numerical_Code**: A unique numerical code assigned to each team member.
- **Task**: Short description of the assigned task.
  
### **Personal Branch Naming Format**
For individual or personal branches (e.g., feature development or bug fixes), use the following format:  
`FIS#_[Numerical_Code]_[PersonalBranch]`

- **FIS#**: Project or module identifier.
- **Numerical_Code**: The same unique code assigned to each member.
- **PersonalBranch**: Specifies that it's a personal or experimental branch.
  
### **Examples of Assigned Branches**

1. **Nicolás's Branch**  
   Previous: `FIS#1_PB_NICO`  
   New: `FIS#_01_PB`

2. **Chay's Branch**  
   Previous: `FIS#1_PB_CHAY`  
   New: `FIS#_02_PB`

3. **Armando's Branch**  
   Previous: `FIS#_PB_ARMANDO`  
   New: `FIS#_03_PB`

4. **Laura's Branch (New Member)**  
   New: `FIS#_04_PB`

### **Numerical Code Assignment**
Each team member receives a unique code, making it easy to add new members. For example:

1. **FIS#_01** – Chay: 
2. **FIS#_02** – Nicolás: 
3. **FIS#_03** – Armando: 
4. **FIS#_04** – Fabio: 
5. **FIS#_05** – Ruby: 
6. **FIS#_06** – Luis: 

### **Process for New Members**
New members will be assigned the next available numerical code. Once their task is defined, a branch will be created using this structure. For example:

- `FIS#_05_NewFeature_Integration`
