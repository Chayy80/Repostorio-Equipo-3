# User Test Result Graphs
During the user testing, a quiet and silent environment was required. To achieve this, access to the library rooms of the Autonomous University of Yucat√°n was requested, where two computers and a microphone were available to record and conduct the tests. Three assistants were hired to monitor and support the user with basic guides.
### The user test consisted of four activities:
- [ ]  Send a message.
- [ ]  Schedule a meeting.
- [ ]  Review notifications.
- [ ]  Enter the "In progress" section of the backlog.

### Activity 1: Send a message.

### Activity 3: Review notifications.

### Activity 4: Enter the "In progress" section of the backlog.
