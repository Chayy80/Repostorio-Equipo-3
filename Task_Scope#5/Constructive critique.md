Our impression of this subject is that it represents one of the most important pillars in our training as future software engineers. Initially, we had the impression that it would be a tedious subject, loaded with theory, but our perception quickly changed when we noticed that it also offers a practical approach that is very enriching. This experience led us to reflect deeply on my career choice. We asked ourselves if this is really the path we want to follow and if we are willing to dedicate the next few years of our lives to practice in this profession. Despite initial doubts, we believe that this type of questioning is essential to reaffirm goals and make more conscious decisions in the future. What we do appreciate is that we enjoyed that all the activities were practical in a controlled environment that allowed us to experience a part of what we will do after this career. Only perhaps we could question the initial topics that are taught, because although relevant, we do not feel that they have much impact on the students when it comes to applying that knowledge in the subject matter.
