- [ ] **Accesibility limitations**

**ClassHub** currently faces accessibility limitations, as it is only compatible with Android devices and personal computers. This excludes students and tutors using other devices.

Our vision is to expand ClassHub **accessibility to all devices** used within the university community, including tablets, laptops, mobile divices, and others,This will enhance inclusion and equity in education.
Our initial focus is to develop a responsive web platform adaptable to various devices, enhancing the user experience.

We will know we are achieving our vision when 90% of students and professors can access ClassHub from different devices.
